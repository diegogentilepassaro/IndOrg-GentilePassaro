                Documentation for the Daily Price Files
          *************************************************

	The data in the A C Nielsen Household Purchase History files was
used to create files which describe the daily purchasing behavior of the
consumers as well as the prices, coupons, and advertising to which they 
were exposed at the time of their purchases.  In short, the daily price
files contain time series data for brands with a market share of at least
1%, giving for each day the consumer behavior, prices, store coupon  
information, and levels of advertising.

	Within chains whose stores had nearly identical pricing behavior, 
those stores had their prices and store coupon information calculated by
chain.  Within market 1 this includes chains 4 and 5.  The other stores were
done on an individual basis.  All stores in market 2 were done individually.

	What follows is a listing of the variables in the datasets PF1.SSD
and PF2.SSD, the price files corresponding to markets 1 (Sioux Falls, South
Dakota) and 2 (Springfield, Missouri).  The files are sorted by UPC (or PID),
by chain, by store id, by date.  Within each store id, the dates are
continuous from the Wednesday prior to the first observation in the HP file
to the Tuesday following the last.

		          Further Notes
		*********************************

1.	Product id numbers were used for categories such as yogurt to group
   together similar types of a single brand (e.g. all fruit variations of 
   Brand A yogurt)

2.	DPR, REG, SCVAL, and MCVAL are all in dollars.

3.	The daily or 'deal' price refers to the price on the shelves which 
   was actually paid by the consumers, prior to any coupons. 

4.	In the original Household Purchase History files there were
   observations which had a non-zero value for SCUNITS (or MCUNITS) but a
   value of zero for SCVAL (or MCVAL).  If such were the case on a given day,
   SCIND (or MCIND) was given a value of 1 and SCVAL (or MCVAL) was given
   a value of -999.

5.	Within a product id in the dry detergent category, certain upc's 
   corresponded to a version of that product for which the manufacturer
   suggested a cut in the regular price, and this suggested price was
   advertised on the label of the product.  The variable CUT gives the
   value of this price cut, and takes on the value zero if no price cut
   was in effect.  The variable CUT is in dollars.
 
6.	Store id's 32, 33, 34, and 35 were dropped from the market 1 price files
   because of extremely low volume.
